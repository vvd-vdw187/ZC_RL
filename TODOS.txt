- Implement using and filling the replay buffer for training. x
    - Put the stuff from the replay buffer to a pytorch tensor. x
- Implement model making . x
    -  Implement the search spaces from the one-shot paper.
- Pass the model to the DQN. x
- Test random search without GraSP. x
    - test it with working models and store performance x
    - test is on google collab, one-shot paper uses 10*6 training steps.x
        - Implement device in agent. x
    - save models
- Maybe change the fill replay buffer?
- Implement GraSP in RS. 
- Test RS with GraSP.
